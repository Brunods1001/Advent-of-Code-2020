128 rows and 8 columns.
Seats are indexed by binary space partitioning.

The first 7 characters are {F, B}. F selects the front half section and B selects the back half section. After 7 partitions, you are left with one row (2^7=128.

The last three characters determine which column to get (2^3=8).

Every seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID 44 * 8 + 5 = 357.

Here are some other boarding passes:

BFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.
FFFBBBFRRR: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.
BBFFBBFRLL: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.

As a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes. What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?
